# Decision Trees Project - Penguin Species Classification

![Penguins](penguin.jpg)

## Introduction

Decision Trees are versatile machine learning models used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we focus on classification using Decision Trees and aim to create a model that can predict the species of penguins based on their physical attributes.

## Project Goals

- Build a Decision Tree classification model for penguin species classification.
- Explore the dataset and perform data preprocessing.
- Visualize the data to gain insights.
- Experiment with hyperparameters of the Decision Tree.
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics.
- Visualize the Decision Tree structure.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Palmer Penguins" dataset, containing information about penguin species based on physical attributes such as culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, body mass, island, and sex.

## Files

- `penguin.jpg`: An image file used for visualization or documentation.
- `decision_trees_penguins.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.

## Project Execution

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the penguin dataset and perform necessary data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand the relationships between features and the distribution of species.

3. **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree classification model on the dataset.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with hyperparameters such as max depth, max leaf nodes, and criterion to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using classification metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and visualize the Decision Tree structure.

## Hyperparameter Experimentation

The project explores the impact of hyperparameters, including:

- **Max Depth**: Controlling the maximum depth of the Decision Tree.
- **Max Leaf Nodes**: Restricting the maximum number of leaf nodes in the tree.
- **Criterion**: Choosing between "gini" and "entropy" as the impurity criterion.

## Results and Insights

The project aims to provide insights into how hyperparameters affect Decision Tree models' performance in penguin species classification. Classification reports, confusion matrices, and Decision Tree visualizations will be used to assess and understand model performance.

## Usage

To replicate this project, run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`decision_trees_penguins.ipynb`) using the penguin dataset. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries and dependencies installed.

## Conclusion

Decision Trees are interpretable and useful models for classification tasks. Understanding the impact of hyperparameters on model performance is essential for building effective machine learning models.
